A laptop computer or notebook computer, also known as a <br /> laptop or notebook, is a small, portable personal computer<br /> (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-<br />panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric<br /> keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid.[1][2]<br /> Most of the computer's internal hardware is in the lower part,<br /> under the keyboard, although many modern laptops have a<br /> built-in webcam at the top of the screen, and some even feature<br /> a touchscreen display. In most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems, laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems, which were originally developed for desktop computers.
